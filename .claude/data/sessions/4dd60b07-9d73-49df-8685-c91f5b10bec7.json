    "can you investigate is g3 does any of this? \"Steve Yegge uses the term \"protomolecule\" in the context of his work on AI agent orchestration, specifically within a system he developed called Gas Town. In this context, a protomolecule is a template for creating workflows for AI coding agents. \nThe \"Protomolecule\" in Gas Town\nIn his Medium post \"Welcome to Gas Town\", Steve Yegge explains the term as an analogy for software templates within his system for managing AI agents and their tasks. \nDefinition: A protomolecule is a template class used for instantiating \"Molecules,\" which are durable, chained workflows of tasks (called \"Beads\").\nFunctionality: It defines the structure and steps of a workflow in advance without being tied to specific work items.\nUsage: The instantiation process involves copying all the protomolecule beads (the individual tasks) and performing variable substitutions to create a real, executable workflow for an AI agent.\nAnalogy: Yegge describes it as creating an entire graph of template issues (e.g., \"design\", \"plan\", \"implement\", \"review\", \"test\") that can be reused, much like a class in object-oriented programming is a template for objects. \nThis usage is a technical term within his specific software project and does not appear to be a direct reference to the fictional substance from The Expanse series, although the naming is likely inspired by it.\""
