    "/plan_w_team  Architect a comprehensive codebase intelligence system that integrates Language Server Protocol (LSP) static analysis with a tri-layered search infrastructure combining lexical codebase indexing, dense vector semantic retrieval, and abstract syntax tree-aware code search to construct a navigable, dependency-resolved knowledge graph of the repository, enabling autonomous AI agents to independently traverse complex code architectures, resolve cross-references, and locate relevant implementation patterns without manual guidance., this task needs to be perfectly orchestrated and that means using protomolecules, molecules and beads"
