    " Analyze the entire codebase to conduct a comprehensive static analysis identifying all disconnected architectural components, orphaned modules, unimported exports, broken dependency injection chains, missing environment variable configurations, unresolved package imports, absent API route registrations, dangling service references, and incomplete build tool configurations. Systematically trace the dependency graph from every entry point to detect: missing npm/yarn/pnpm packages in package.json that are referenced in code but not declared; internal modules that export functionality never consumed by dependents; circular dependencies causing runtime failures; configuration files lacking required sections; database migrations not wired to ORM configurations; middleware stacks missing critical pipeline stages; and microservice endpoints failing to register with service discovery. For each identified gap, provide the precise file path, line numbers, specific error manifestations including compilation failures, runtime exceptions, or silent failures, severity classification ranging from critical blocking to high risk to technical debt, and exact remediation steps including the specific import statements, package installation commands, configuration amendments, or architectural refactorings required to restore connectivity, ensuring all fixes maintain backward compatibility where applicable and include verification commands or test cases to validate the resolution."
